"""
Gillespie stochastic simulation of homologous recombination, specifically of 
RAD51-mediated strand exchange and homology search after double strand break formation.
It is the same odel as genomatch (monte carlo) but using the Gillespie algorithm.

usage:
    genomatch-gillespie [-hv] <command> [<args>...]

options:
    -h, --help                  shows the help
    -v, --version               shows the version

The subcommands are:
    
    run             Run the pipeline
